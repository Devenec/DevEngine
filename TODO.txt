DevEngine - TODO
----------------

- Design how content loaders (inherited from Content::ContentLoader) should work. Currently, an instance is created each
	time a single asset needs to be loaded, and destroyed after the loading is done. This lowers memory consumption, but
	should the loaders be cached?

- Should very long filepaths be supported (Core::FileStream)?

- Should console be supported in production build?

- Should small icons (16 x 16) be supported with windows? The internal downscaling of large icons seems to produce
	no-so-good quality.

- Should FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS and FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_ACCESS -modes be supported (Core::FileStream)?

- Should UserSearchPath be supported with SymInitialize (Debug::StackTrace)?
